Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject

    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you can't go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd countdownchamp
  npm start

Happy hacking!
