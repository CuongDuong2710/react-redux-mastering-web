Success! Created countdownchamp at Z:\react\countdownchamp
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you can't go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd countdownchamp
  npm start

Happy hacking!

Npm is a package manager for node modules. Node modules are packages of javascript code that help applications run.
 There's probably alternatives, but the command line is the quickest way to set up a project. As you continue to explore programming, you'll find the command line to be not just useful, but necessary.

Q&A
Hi. Why is Component imported in curly brackets?
 
The Component is imported in curly brackets because it's not the default class for the 'react' module.
React is the default module. However, it's still exported from the same file location. When it's not the default class, but still exported, we can access it through curly brackets.
